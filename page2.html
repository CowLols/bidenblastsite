    <h1>The Biden Blast</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The Biden Blast is Joe's main move. It is so powerful that entire cities have been destroyed.
        There is no known way to escape its destruction. Prolonged exposure to the radiation left by the Biden Blast can cause serious health issues years after exposure.
        If you are exposed to any of the radiation from the blast, please take all radiation exposure safety precautions. The survival rate of this attack is astronomically low at just 0.5%!
        Once more research is able to be done, we will understand the effects of this attack more.

        Thank you for taking the time to learn about the Biden Blast.
